       - Recommends antivirus software.
       - Highlights the importance of Two-Factor Authentication (2FA).

     - **Internet Speed Test**:
       - Measures download speed, upload speed, and ping time, providing valuable metrics for remote work performance.

     ## Installation

     ### Prerequisites
     - Python 3.6 or higher
     - [speedtest-cli](https://pypi.org/project/speedtest-cli/) library for internet speed testing

     ### Steps
     1. Clone this repository:
        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/yourusername/remote-work-readiness-checker.git
        cd remote-work-readiness-checker
        ```

     2. Set up a virtual environment:
        ```bash
        python3 -m venv venv
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

     3. Install the required packages:
        ```bash
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```

     ## Usage
     1. Ensure the virtual environment is activated:
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

     2. Run the main script to check system readiness:
        ```bash
        python main.py
        ```
